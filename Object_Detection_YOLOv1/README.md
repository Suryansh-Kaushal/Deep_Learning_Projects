This repository contains the code and documentation for an object detection model developed using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. The model can detect and classify objects in images with high accuracy.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a robust object detection model that can accurately identify and classify objects in images. The YOLO algorithm is used for its efficiency and effectiveness in real-time object detection tasks.

## Approach

The project follows these steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: The PASCAL VOC dataset from 2007 is used for training and evaluation. The dataset consists of annotated images with bounding boxes and object labels.

2. **Data Processing**: The dataset is processed to extract image paths and corresponding labels. The images are resized and normalized for consistency. Labels are converted into a suitable format for training.

3. **Model Architecture**: The YOLO algorithm is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture consists of convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. The YOLO head is utilized to reshape the model's output to obtain class probabilities, confidence scores, and bounding box coordinates.

4. **Training**: The model is trained using the prepared dataset. The training process optimizes the model's parameters to minimize the loss function, which combines classification and localization losses.

5. **Inference**: After training, the model is used for making predictions on new images. The algorithm detects objects, provides class probabilities, and predicts bounding box coordinates.

## Results

The YOLO-based object detection model achieves high accuracy in detecting and classifying objects in images. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the YOLO algorithm in object recognition tasks.
